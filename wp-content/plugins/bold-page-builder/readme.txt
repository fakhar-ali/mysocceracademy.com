== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this compare to front end builders? =
 
While front end builders are nice and easy to use with simple content, there is no substitute for robustness of good back end builder in case you want to build complex layouts. Once you get to know it, Bold Builder, with its advanced capabilities (like stacked clipboard and non-AJAX instant editing), is the fastest way to build your pages.
 
= Is there a premium version? =
 
No. Actually this is premium version, only difference is that it's free. :)

= Which themes are supported? =
 
It is not possible to test Bold Builder with all themes - it should work fine with most but we recommend Twenty Sixteen and Twenty Seventeen themes. Also, in case you want to use our premium themes, you can find them here: [BoldThemes Portfolio](https://themeforest.net/user/boldthemes/portfolio?ref=bold-page-builder "BoldThemes Portfolio").
